Numerical Simulation and Analysis System (in portuguese, "Sistema de Simulação Numérica e Análises -- SSNA) is a free open source program defining a system for numerical simulation of electromagnetics problems, with the parallel processing resource. Actually, the numerical method implemented is only the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) in tree dimensions (3D), which is employed for the simulations. Integration with other ones is further propose.

The system accomplishes three stages:

a) the pre-processing, which defines the geometric and material properties of the problem objects, the grid and time step, the overall system characteristics and estimate the total memory and time for the simulation;

b) the processing, which will calculate the electromagnetic fields at all points of the grid along the time; and

c) the pos-processing, which will permit to visualize the geometry and results and is intended to calculate other physical data, like energy, force, and mathematical data, like Fourier Transform.

The development is focused, in first instance, for Linux Operating System. It is considered that there is the possibility of compiling and using on other platforms too.

Note: the code will be uploaded soon.
